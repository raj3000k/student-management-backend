If incase want to check the end points manually using FastAPI Docs use the below url

**Highly recommended if automatic system fails check with the FastAPI DOCS**

**URL** `https://student-management-backend-au5p.onrender.com/docs/`

**Base URL** : `https://student-management-backend-au5p.onrender.com`

# API End Points Functioning:

- POST /students to create new students
- GET /students to list out all the students (also can query with age and country as mentioned in the task)
- GET /students{id} Fetch student details using their id
- PATCH /students{id} Update students details using their id
- DELETE /students{id} Delete a particular students details from the DB using their id.

# Mentions:

- Tried a Production level coding style/practice for better scalability.
- Proper Placement of environment variables of MongoDB Creditionals (for security).
- Tried to name the variables & functions easy to understand for anyone.

PS: - looking forward to working with you guys :-)
